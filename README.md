Ongoing project to find three-dimensional k-means clustering and k-NN inspired analytical methods. aiming to determine correlation between two planes of data that are dependent on both dataset and dimension. requires implementation of distance methods. currently assessing using euclidean, although future projects with other calculations may be necessary. further aims: determine the smallest k distances of points in df2 from df1 and averaging that distance, extrapolating into a randomized directional point on the spherical radius of df1 point (or a fixed, such as only on the y-axis), then assessing the regression model for the points generated by the least distances average using a hypothesis test, ignoring intercept values. if the corresponding parameter estimates are statistically signficant at a = 0.05, correlation is less supported
